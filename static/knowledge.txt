Projects
Study of BurgersHuxley Equation Using Neural Network | IIT Roorkee (August 2024 - November 2024)
- A neural network approach based on Lie series in Lie groups of differential equations (symmetry) for solving Burgersâ€“Huxley nonlinear partial differential equations, considering initial or boundary value terms in the loss functions. 
- The proposed technique yields closed analytic solutions that possess excellent generalization properties. 
- This approach differs from existing deep neural networks in that it employs only shallow neural networks. This choice significantly reduces the parameter cost while retaining the dynamic behavior and accuracy of the solution. A thorough comparison with its exact solution was carried out to validate the practicality and effectiveness of proposed method.

AI Chatbot | Self Project (August 2024)
- Formulated LLM project using Langchain and Streamlit to build a news research tool for equity analysts.
- Created an AI chatbot that assists in conducting research by providing accurate information from news sources.
- Implemented OpenAI API and FAISS for generating responses and vector-based retrieval of relevant news articles.

Crop Recommendation System Using ML | Mathematics Department, IIT Roorkee (December 2023 - February 2024)
- Developed Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN, achieving ensemble model accuracy of 94%.
- Generated Artificial Data for various crops, Designed the fully functional Django App for Recommendations.
- Analyzed over 7 critical environmental variables, including soil type and pH levels, to develop tailored recommendations.

Enhanced Secret Sharing Scheme Using Cryptography | IIT Roorkee (January 2023 - May 2023)
- Innovated a Doubly secured system using Python's PyCrypto toolkit to significantly enhance data confidentiality.
- Implemented encryption algorithms (DES, 3DES, AES, ARC4, CAST128) alongside Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.
- Applied mathematical concepts such as Lagrange Interpolation Theorem, for accurate share regeneration.
